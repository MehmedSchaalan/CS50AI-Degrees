### According to the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon game, anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film that two actors both starred in.

In this problem, we’re interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in “X-Men: First Class,” and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in “Apollo 13.”

We can formulate it as a search problem: our states are people. Our actions are movies that take us from one actor to another (although a movie may lead us to several different actors, but that's okay with this problem). Our initial state and the target state are determined by the two people we try to connect. By using Breadth First Search, we can find the shortest path from one actor to the next.
